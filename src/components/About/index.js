          I am a team player. I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get
          across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a
          person should work on developing their professional skills and
          learning new things all the time.

          My name is Christian Vasquez, and I decided to change my occupation
          after ten years of working in automotive sales. I still like
          communicating with people and working in a team setting. As an
          automotive sales agent, I learned what makes a product valuable and
          easy to sell besides promotion and persuasiveness. I have realized
          that the future is in "Tech", and have started my journey, into full
          stack development. I have become interested in these fields recently
          and have committed myself to learning these programming languages by
          enrolling into a "Bootcamp". My professional expertise in sales can
          provide valuable insights and a fresh perspective on helping the
          client reach out to the consumer, by simplifying the User Experience.
          Personally, I can acquire new knowledge and skills in Data Analytics.
          I am ready for long-time cooperation
